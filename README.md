## Gubbys Script & Details

shaders script for roblox (not super realistic or anything lol). i added bloom and a blur-like effect. if it doesn't look good or breaks in a game, just try it in another one. was mainly made for **The Strongest Battlegrounds**.

## Whats New in This Pull Request

hey, i added some stuff to make it more user-friendly and work better on low-end devices (like phones and older pcs).  
also added a UI at the start using Rayfield so ppl can choose how much "shader" they want.

### Added:
- slider with 3 levels: low, medium, high  
- low = for mobile n weak devices  
- high = rtx-like (kinda), looks nice but might lag  
- auto removes old lighting effects before applying new ones  
- cleaner and a bit optimized

the script shouldnt lag now if u set it to 1 or 2, and it looks way better at 3. u can switch it in-game too if u want.

if anything breaks or u got ideas, lmk
